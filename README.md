Productive Work
--------------------

Automated tool changing

:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x984YnCcOYs
	Management of the Robot from the tooling station to the press.

​	the robot in capable to recognize the useful tool and store the other in the magazine.

​	The Position of the tool is variable can be rearranged and it is not "hardcoded"

6+3 axis CAM
:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZXSkwGmM0c
	Plugin in Rhinoceros to create program for the Kuka Robot.

​	The code is not "Static" and the postprocessor is design to behave like a program made by the user on the robot.

​	The requirement is needed because the position of the piece can change and the plastic is not "Stable". so it is not possible to run a continuos line of point

Art Viz
:	https://www.blender.it/members/stefanobranca/media/photo/
​	installed a raspberry with a GPS Shield in the car to automatically keep track of my position and send me a telegram message where my position was in the 500 m range from the company building.



Work for Fablab-Castelfranco
:	https://www.facebook.com/FabLabCFV/videos/313433039614734
​	Integration with ROS and OpenCV for Faire.
:	https://www.facebook.com/FabLabCFV/videos/313433039614734
​	Script to convert 3dScan to Video for "Cheap" 3d hologram for Faire to run on smartphone. the scan were made with a simple Kinect.




Fun Work
--------------------

Cycling Matrix
:   https://github.com/Kellogio/RandomCode/blob/main/Cycling%20Matrix/cycler.py
	when they asked me to code a solution for this problem i thought at most some loop cycle but it had shown that it was a little bit harder. 
	i requested the help of some friend to finish it at that time but i had learn not to under-estimate any task

4MotorLamp
:   https://github.com/Kellogio/RandomCode/blob/main/4MotorLamp/lamp.py
	Much older Code.
	Communication with PLC and triangulation for all 4 motor.

Automatic Login for work
:	No Code Available because scattered in the OS of the raspberry 

 	installed a raspberry with a GPS Shield in the car to automatically keep track of my position and send me a telegram message where my position was in the 500 m range from the company building.
